# BGP
## Summary AS-SET

Summarized routes learned by eBGP from different ASNs can be sent to routers within an iBGP, the problem is if one of the eBGP routers loses connectivity with the networks that are advertising the peer router tries to find it through the same interface that it learns because it is a summarized route. 

## Topology
![Topology](https://github.com/ivandelgadilloz/BGP-notes/blob/main/assets/images/as-set.png?raw=true)

# CLI
## CORE-1
Summary 180.0.0.0/16 
```py
CORE-1#show running-config | sec bgp
router bgp 1010
 !
 address-family ipv4
  aggregate-address 180.0.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only
```
```py
CORE-1#show bgp | in Network|180
     Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path
 s    180.0.0.0/24     10.28.28.8                             0 800 900 700 i
 *>   180.0.0.0        0.0.0.0                            32768 i
 s    180.0.1.0/24     6.6.6.6                                0 600 700 900 800 i
```
## PE-2
Learned 180.0.0.0/16 from 100.1.1.1 CORE-1 
```py
PE-2#show bgp ipv4 unicast 180.0.0.0
BGP routing table entry for 180.0.0.0/16, version 88
Paths: (1 available, best #1, table default)
  Advertised to update-groups:
     7
  Refresh Epoch 1
  Local, (aggregated by 1010 100.1.1.1)
    100.1.1.1 (metric 10) from 100.1.1.1 (100.1.1.1)
      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal, atomic-aggregate, best
      rx pathid: 0, tx pathid: 0x0
```

At this point the PE-2 router learns the summarized route, but the CORE-1 sends that summarized route over all eBGP connections.
This indicates that the router that is advertising the 180.0.0.0.0/24 prefix will receive the 180.0.0.0.0/16 summarized route from CORE-1 and this will create a LOOP.

## AS-SET on CORE-1
This setting is to indicate that a route cannot be learned with the same ASN source.

## CORE-1
```py
CORE-1#show running-config | sec bgp
router bgp 1010
 !
 address-family ipv4
  aggregate-address 180.0.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only as-set
```
```py
CORE-1#show bgp | in Network|180
     Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path
 *>   180.0.0.0        0.0.0.0                       100  32768 {600,700,800} i

 symbols { } indicate that the route cannot be advertised to those destinations if they are the origin.
```
