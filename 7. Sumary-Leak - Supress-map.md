## Summary leak

Summarization is a technique for forwarding learned networks into a single summarized network, but Sumary-Leak excludes a network from summarization.

# CLI
## CORE-1
Exclude Network 172.16.102.0/24 from 172.16.100.0/22
```py
ip access-list extended ACL-LEAK
 permit ip 172.16.102.0 0.0.0.255 any
```
Create a PBR and match with ACL
```py
route-map PBR-LEAK deny 10
 match ip address ACL-LEAK

deny 172.16.102.0/24 on summarization
```
PBR permit 20 is match with all networks and send 172.16.102.0/24

```py
route-map PBR-LEAK permit 20
```

# Verification on PE-6
```py
PE-6#show ip route bgp
Gateway of last resort is not set
